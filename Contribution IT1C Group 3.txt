For sprint 3, we worked as a team on checking the overall quality of the code and tried each function to enssure eevrything was working smoothly.
Lukas and Jari .....

Following the schema of sprint 2, we remained with the same variable letters. Melissa took care of A with the ordering drinks, Jari of the B one managing activity supervisors and 
Lukas with C managing activity parcticipants. This time we created the checklist for the user stories ourselves and then implemented our codes individually to meet the 
requirements, adding the necessary functions and improvements. 
Once again we stated that we wouldn't be involved in another's teammate code, but insted focused on our own variants. The team support was present when we came up with questions 
and at the time of giving feedback on new ideas for the project.
