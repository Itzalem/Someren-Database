For sprint 2, Lukas and Jari created the necessary tables in the Microsoft SQL Server Management Software, while Melissa was setting up the MVC project solution, 
including making the necessary style changes to the Home page for a smoother user experience.

Each member chose a variant. For both assignments Melissa took care of the Students requirements, Lukas the Rooms and Jari the Lecturers. 
We wrote and implemented our code individually, in which we overall connected successfully the DB with the project and added the CRUD functionalities. 
Following the users' stories we created a list for each group, continuing with the options of adding, editing and finally deleting. 
Each one, on their own code according to the variant we chose, added extra features like filtering, searching and preselecting in some cases. 
No one was involved in another's teammate code, we limited ourselves to the chosen variant in both assignments, solving challenges and coming up with ideas as a team 
but implementing them independently.
